    <h1>Assignment 3: Higher-Order Functions, Algebraic Data Types, and Pattern Matching in Swift</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>Due Wednesday, August 25 at 11:59 PM</p>

    <h2>Goals for This Assignment</h2>
    <p>By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work with the basics of the syntax of Swift</li>
      <li>Define a list with an algebraic data type (<code>enum</code> in Swift)</li>
      <li>Deconstruct algebraic data types with pattern matching (<code>switch</code> in Swift)</li>
      <li>Define methods which take higher-order functions</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Provided files:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="main.swift"><code>main.swift</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Get Swift Working</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you'll be using Swift.
      You can either install Swift from <a href="https://swift.org/download/#releases">this link</a>, or run it in the browser <a href="http://online.swiftplayground.run/">here</a>.
      Binaries are available for Ubuntu Linux and Mac OS X.
      Exactly which method you use doesn't matter; it will work the same either way.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement a Singly-Linked List</h2>
    <p>
      A significant of code has been provided in <a href="main.swift"><code>main.swift</code></a>, including a test suite of significant size.
      As with assignment 1, you are tasked with writing a singly-linked list.
      However, this time around, you'll be doing this in Swift.
      Instead of using dynamic dispatch to select between <code>cons</code> and <code>nil</code> behavior, you'll be using pattern matching via <code>switch</code>.
      Additionally, you'll also be defining key list-based operations which work with higher-order functions, namely <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code>.
      The comments in the file provide further details.
      Note that the tests themselves are a rich source of information, both in terms of defining what you need to implement (i.e., they serve as a specification), and how Swift works.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Turn in Your Code Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 333 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 3&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>main.swift</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
