    <h2>Goals for This Assignment</h2>
    <p>By the time you have completed this work, you should be able to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand a code's specification from a test suite</li>
      <li>Work with the basics of the syntax of JavaScript</li>
      <li>Use prototype-based inheritance to reuse code</li>
      <li>Use virtual dispatch to encode different behaviors</li>
    </ul>
    <b>Provided files:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="list.js"><code>list.js</code></a></li>
      <li><a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Step-by-Step Instructions</h1>

    <h2>Step 1: Get JavaScript Working</h2>
    <p>
      For this assignment, you'll be using JavaScript.
      It's possible to make this assignment work in any Web browser, though it may require some modification to make the output reasonable.
      It's recommended to use <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> as your implementation, which can be installed on all major platforms.
      Node.js can also be run directly in the browser <a href="https://repl.it/languages/nodejs">here</a>, if you prefer.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 2: Implement a Singly-Linked List</h2>
    <p>
      A significant of code has been provided in <a href="list.js"><code>list.js</code></a>, including a test suite of significant size.
      Your goal with this assignment is to get all the tests passing, without modifying any of the testing code.
      The comments in the file provide further details.
      Note that the tests themselves are a rich source of information, both in terms of defining what you need to implement (i.e., they serve as a specification), and how JavaScript works.
    </p>

    <h2>Step 3: Turn in Your Code Using <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a></h2>
    <p>
      Log into <a href="https://canvas.csun.edu">Canvas</a>, and go to the COMP 333 class.
      Click &ldquo;Assignments&rdquo; on the left pane, then click &ldquo;Assignment 2&rdquo;.
      From here, you need to upload the following files:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>list.js</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      In addition, if you collaborated with anyone else, be sure to download <a href="collaborators.txt"><code>collaborators.txt</code></a> and write the names of the people you collaborated with in the file, one per line.
      Please submit this file along with the other files.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can turn in the assignment multiple times, but only the last version you submitted will be graded.
